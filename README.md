# code_challenge

This challenge will test your knowledge of Git, Node/NPM, Express, Javascript, React Native, MongoDB

Prerequistes

- Node
- NPM
- XCode

First you will need to make a clone of this repo locally on your machine and create a seperate branched named your name.

Next make an express node application server. see - https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html

Next create an index route '/',
'/users' route
'/places' route

Next attach a MongoDB Database to the app server and use Mongoose Library. see - https://blog.xervo.io/mongodb-tutorial

Next create a sample set of data for both /users and /places so when you hit either one of those endpoints, data is returned from the MongoDB database.

Next on the Front-End, create a base react-native iOS project. see - https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content

Next create two buttons on the landing page of the iOS app, one for users and another for places. When you click a button it should take you to a new screen which lists the data from our back-end.
